recipeingredient:
- "4.5 pounds chicken wings"
- "3/4 cup Hoisin sauce"
- "1/2 cup soy sauce"
- "1/4-1/2 cup sugar depending on how sweet your Hoisin sauce is and how sweet you like your food"
- "1/4 cup sriracha"
- "1/4 cup fresh lime juice"
- "1 large shallot minced"
- "2 green onions chopped"
- "2 large cloves garlic grated"
- " Optional 1 to 2 Tablespoons red chili flakes for additional heat"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put all ingredients in a large mixing bowl &amp; mix thoroughly to combine and incorporate all marinade ingredients with the chicken. Let chicken marinate for at least 3 hours &amp; up to overnight, refrigerated, redistributing 3 or 4 times to make sure all the chicken gets evenly marinated.  Alternatively, you can split the chicken and marinade evenly into two Ziploc gallon sized bags, suck the air out before sealing completely, and lay the bags on their sides."
- "60 to 90 minutes before roasting, take the chicken out of the refrigerator to bring it up to room temp and preheat the oven to 425F. (The colder the ambient temp, the longer to bring the chicken up to room temp.)  Once chicken is brought up to room temp and oven is preheated, place the wings on a sheet pan (foil lining makes easy cleanup) and roast for 20 minutes."
- "After 20 minutes of roasting, either brush or dunk the wings with more marinade, setting them back on the sheet pan upside down so both sides get even exposure to the heat. Roast for another 20 minutes."
- "Repeat the process, setting the wings right side up again on the sheet pan and roast another 20 to 30 minutes, depending on the size of the wings."
- "Enjoy!"

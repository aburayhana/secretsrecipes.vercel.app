- "1 each teaspoon of water and katakuriko Katakuriko dissolved in water"
- " A seasonings"
- "1 knob Ginger finely chopped"
- "1 clove Garlic finely chopped"
- "1/2 handful Green onion finely chopped"

- "1/2 tsp Sesame oil"
- "5 drops  Rayu"
- "1 Japanese leek to garnish green onion look pretty"
- "1 Sansho pepper Szechuan pepper is better"
recipeinstructions:
- "Drain the tofu in a colander. Combine &#34;B&#34; seasonings. (Weipa doesn&#39;t have to be dissolved completely at this point.)"
- "Put 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil (not listed in the ingredients) in a frying pan. Add the &#34;A&#34; seasonings and fry over a low heat to evaporate the excess moisture of doubanjiang. Fry until fragrant without letting it burn."
- "Add the minced pork and break it up with a wooden spatula. Cook through over medium heat. After cooking the pork through, add the &#34;B&#34; seasonings and stir well with a wooden spatula until the seasonings are completely dissolved."
- "After it comes to a boil, cut the tofu into large bite sizes with a spoon and add to the frying pan. It is better to use a spoon than a knife because it creates a surface that absorbs the sauce better."
- "Check the seasoning. If it is too strong, add more Chinese soup stock. Stir carefully without breaking the tofu."
- "Continue to cook over medium heat for about 3 minutes until the sauce thickens (reduced to 2/3). Add katakuriko dissolved in water to thicken the sauce."
- "Reduce the sauce well first before adding the katakuriko slurry, otherwise the sauce won&#39;t thicken! If it is not thickened enough, add more."
- "Turn the heat off and add the &#34;C&#34; seasonings (this decides the overall flavor of the dish!). Transfer to a serving dish and sprinkle with green onion."

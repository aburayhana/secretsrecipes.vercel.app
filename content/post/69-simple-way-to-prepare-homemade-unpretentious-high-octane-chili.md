recipeinstructions:
- "Nothing complicatedhere! Hardest part is making sure you have all ingredients. Adjust spiciness by jalapeno. 1 low, 2 medium, 3 hot! Roughly or finely chop veggies to preference."
- "Brown meat with jalapenos thinly sliced in sauce pan. Drain off meat or not. I prefer not. It obviously adds flavor and volume to keep it."
- "Combine all ingredients including meat in medium to lg crock pot and cook on low or high as desired. We leave on low and eat throughout day and sometimes into next. Seems to get better over time. Refridgerate leftovers at end of first or second day"
- "Comment: Have read a lot of chili opinion articles and tried many recommendations for meat. Good old fashioned fatty hamburger seems best to me. Not sure why everyone wants to make chili complicated or lean. It doesnt take much chili it seems to me to satisfy your hunger so why try to keep the cals super low. Some substitute turkey then they add sour cream or cheese or crackers to it to get some flavor. Good Lord, people! You just defeated your purpose. Lol. Enjoy."

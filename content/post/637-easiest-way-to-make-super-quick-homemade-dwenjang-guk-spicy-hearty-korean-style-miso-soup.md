recipeinstructions:

- "EXTRUDING LIQUID FROM GREENS: Just wash the greens, sprinkle them with salt, and let them sit for a couple of hours, tossing them 2 or 3 times during the process, letting the salt draw the moisture from them. After they&#39;ve released the excess liquid, just give them a good swish in a big bowl full of clean water, and squeeeeeeeze all that liquid out. You can then freeze the greens for future use, or refrigerate them for 2 to 3 weeks before using."

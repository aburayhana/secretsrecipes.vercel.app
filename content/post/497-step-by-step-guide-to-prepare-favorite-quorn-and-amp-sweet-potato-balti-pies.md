recipeingredient:
- " For the filling"
- "1/2 vegetable stock cube"
- "200 ml boiling water"
- "1 tablespoon butter"
- "1 onion finely chopped"
- "50 g mushrooms sliced"
- "1 clove garlic minced"
- "1 green chilli finely chopped"
- "1 tablespoon plain flour"
- "1 tablespoon curry powder Madras or other"
- "1/2 tablespoon ground ginger"
- "1/2 tablespoon ground cumin"
- "1/2 teaspoon garam masala"
- "1/2 tablespoon ground coriander"
- "50 g sweetcorn"
- "150 g Quorn pieces"
- "1 medium sweet potato peeled and diced"
- " For the hot crust pastry"
- "400 g plain flour"
- "80 g strong white plain flour"
- "80 g unsalted butter"
- "1 1/2 teaspoons salt"
- "200 ml boiling water"
- "100 g lard melted"
- "1 beaten egg for glazing"
recipeinstructions:
- "Pre-heat your oven to 220 C / Gas 7. Have a 12 hole muffin tin ready (no need to grease it)."
- "For the filling add the stock to the boiling water and let it dissolve. In a large saucepan melt the butter. Add the onions, mushrooms, garlic and chilli. Gently cook until the onions are soft and translucent. Add the stock in and then the flour. Stir in so the flour is completely combined. Next add all the spices and the rest of the ingredients. Stir thoroughly and let it all simmer for around 15 minutes, stirring occasionally."
- "To make the pastry, add both flours to a large bowl and rub in the butter. Add the salt to the boiling water so that it dissolves. Add the melted lard into the boiling water/salt and then pour this into the flour mixture. Initially, because it will be hot, mix this with a spoon so that the pastry starts to form. Once cool enough take the dough out of the bowl and transfer to a lightly floured surface."
- "Work the dough into a ball. Roll it out to a thickness of around 1cm and then cut into circles of around 10cm, enough to fit each “well” of the muffin tin. Press these into the muffin tins and then cut out another 12 circles of around 8cm for the lids of the pies."
- "Fill each pie case with around 2 to 3 tablespoons of the prepared mixture. Be careful not to overfill, you don’t want it to burst through the lid during baking. Add your lids and crimp the edges to the body of the pies. Make a hole in the top of each pie to let steam escape during baking. Finally brush some of the beaten egg over the top of each pie so that you get that lovely golden finish when they are cooked. Pop them in the oven and bake for 50 minutes."
- "Once baked remove from the oven and let them stand for 5 minutes before remove from each muffin case and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely."

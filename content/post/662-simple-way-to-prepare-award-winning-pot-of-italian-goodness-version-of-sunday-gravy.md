- "2 lb Pork Country Ribs"

recipeinstructions:
- "Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large stock pot.  Brown all the meat ingredients. Do each one at a time. Start with sausage, then meatballs, pork ribs, and lastly the beef necks. After each ingredient is  browned, take it out and set it aside. For the sausage, use 2-3 links cut into small bite-sized pieces.  NOTE: The reality of getting exactly 2lbs of one ingredient or another, isn&#39;t possible.  So, feel free to add a bit more of one thing or another depending on preference."
- "As you&#39;re browning the beef necks, dice your onion. Once browned, throw the onion in and saut? for 5 mins."
- "Mince garlic cloves and throw them in the pot.  Saut? for another 5 mins."
- "Add in tomato paste.  Coat all ingredients.  (Sometimes I use the paste with Italian seasoning. Your preference is fine.)"
- "Add whole tomatoes, juice and all. While you are putting the tomatoes in the pot, crush each one with your hand."
- "Add bay leaves. And keep heat on medium low until the mixture hits a low, slow boil.  Periodically stirring.  By this time, you&#39;ve probably been cooking 30 mins.  Cook another 30 and then turn the heat down to a low simmer."
- "After 1 full hour, add the browned pork ribs."
- "After another hour add the sausage.  Periodically stirring."
- "After another hour, salt and pepper the sauce to taste. Then add the meatballs.  Cook for one last hour."
- "You can always eat this dish alone.  But consider eating this Pot of Italian Goodness with garlic bread, a side salad, or a side of pasta."

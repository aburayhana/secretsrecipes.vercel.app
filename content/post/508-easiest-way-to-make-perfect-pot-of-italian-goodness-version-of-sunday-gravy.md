recipeinstructions:
- "Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large stock pot.  Brown all the meat ingredients. Do each one at a time. Start with sausage, then meatballs, pork ribs, and lastly the beef necks. After each ingredient is  browned, take it out and set it aside. For the sausage, use 2-3 links cut into small bite-sized pieces.

- "Mince garlic cloves and throw them in the pot.  Saut? for another 5 mins."
- "Add in tomato paste.  Coat all ingredients.  (Sometimes I use the paste with Italian seasoning. Your preference is fine.)"
- "Add whole tomatoes, juice and all. While you are putting the tomatoes in the pot, crush each one with your hand."
- "Add bay leaves. And keep heat on medium low until the mixture hits a low, slow boil.  Periodically stirring.  By this time, you&#39;ve probably been cooking 30 mins.  Cook another 30 and then turn the heat down to a low simmer."

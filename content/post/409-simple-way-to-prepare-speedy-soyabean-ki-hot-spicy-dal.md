If you don&#39;t add salt,then the bean will get over cooked and get mashed. Grind the items given under the table &#39;To grind&#39; to a coarse paste and keep a side. If you use a homemade version (which tends to have a slightly stronger flavour and smell) or a varied version with extra spice and/or seasoning, the outcome of the soup will be different. If you&#39;re using these kinds, I recommend using less than what my recipe calls for.

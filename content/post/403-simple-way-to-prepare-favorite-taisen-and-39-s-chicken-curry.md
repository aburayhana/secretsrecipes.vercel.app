recipeinstructions:
- "cook chicken in a pot on the stove with half water and half chicken broth. cook all the way through! I normally use half a box of broth for this along with some curry powder in the liquid. You can also just use water and add about 3 to 5 chicken bouillon cubes.  Use this broth to make the sauce. If you need more broth use a can , box broth or make your own."
- "pull the chicken out of the pot. you can save the broth from this to use if you like. I never have. cool the chicken down on a plate so that you dont burn your fingers."
- "while the chicken is cooling down cut and chop up some onion to start the sauce."
- "put a little bit of oil ( enough to fry the onions) until they are a bit translucent. add in a few dashes of both curry powders to this. I use more than a few dashes. I use about 3 to 4 tablespoons."
- "after the onions have turned translucent add in a bit of flour. mix and make it a thick paste. after it is a mixed paste slowly add in chicken broth a little at a time making a gravy."
- "if you make it to thin add flour and broth mixed together in a separate bowl but do it slow as it will thicken very fast.  if it is to thick add more broth. The other thing that you can do is make some broth add in some curry powder,  and cook for a few minutes and add in cornstarch or flour.  Add slowly to desired thickness."
- "add more curry powder.  both of them. do not over do it as curry powder gets spicy the longer it sits and simmers.  add about 4 teaspoons of each one. mix well on a low setting.  you dont want this boiling.  stir a lot. let it simmer. The curry powder needs to cook. It works better to cook it separately in broth and then add. If you want to add directly in the sauce make sure to cook it for at least 15 minutes or longer."
- "I let mine simmer stirring every 10 to 15 minutes. I usually let this cook for about 20 to 40 minutes depending on the flavor as I always adjust the spiciness to our tastes."
- "while that is simmering take the chicken and pull it apart into pieces. your choice shred small or big"
- "add the chicken pieces into the sauce and stir"
- "I recommend that you taste the sauce at least every 20 minutes.  I let mine simmer for about 2 to 3 hours . you can also freeze the sauce after it cools down."
- "taste taste taste! if you want it mild dont add to much pepper or curry powder.  if you like spicy add more"
- "while the sauce is simmering peel and chop toppings. save the bananas for last as they get brown. put each topping in a separate bowl with a spoon or cover if needed.  any canned that has juice drain the juice.  cook your rice"
- "when rice is done drain and put it in a bowl. then serve all. put the rice on a plate first then some sauce and let everyone pick the toppings!!"

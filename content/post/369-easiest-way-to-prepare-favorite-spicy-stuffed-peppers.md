recipeingredient:
- "8 bell peppers or any color for that matter"
- "3 lb ground beef no less then 25lbs"
- "1/2 cup uncooked long grain white rice"
- "1 can Campbells family sized tomato soup"
- "2 tbsp garlic powder"
- "1/2 cup Worcestershire sauce"
- "2 tbsp onion powder"
- "2 tbsp Italian Seasoning"
- "1/2 cup hot sauce"
- "2 tbsp Mrs Dash Extra Spicy Seasoning Blend"
- "1 tbsp salt and pepper"
- "1 (6 oz) can of tomato paste"
- "1 bottle Heinz 57 sauce"
recipeinstructions:
- "Remove and discard the tops of those peppers. All of them. Get spoon and scoop them clean- seeds, membranes- all of it. Rinse and set them aside."
- "Preheat oven to 300."
- "Cook the rice- put it in a saucepan with water and bring it to a boil. Reduce heat, cover and cook for 20 mins. (Until they&#39;re cooked all the way.) Drain."
- "Brown that beef. Put it in a pan, mix, stir and cook until brown. Drain that nasty oil."
- "Don&#39;t wash your hands yet. Take your mixture and start stuffing the heck out of those peppers. Fill those babies tight and full. Let them over flow a little, they can look like cupcakes."
- "Grab your Heinz. Go ahead and squirt some of it over the over flow of meat coming out of those peppers. (Cupcakes need icing!)"
- "Get a bowl. A big one. Your hands are about to get dirty. Add the browned beef, rice, the can of paste, all of the seasonings. Pretty much everything except the tomato soup and Heinz. (Don&#39;t touch that stuff, we aren&#39;t using it yet.) Get your hands in there- mix everything, mix it real good. Go ahead and taste it. You may want to add more salt or one of the seasonings- add more if you want."
- "Get that big pot out. Pour your tomato soup in it; add 1 cup of water for now. Mix it real good. Stir harder, don&#39;t be lazy."
- "Arrange the peppers in your big pot. (Yes, they&#39;re going into the tomato soup.) Now- add more water. The soup/water needs to come up to the very top of the peppers, completely covering those babies. (The peppers. Not the meat that&#39;s over flowing out of them.)"
- "Put a cover on your big pot (I just use foil) and put those babies in the oven. They need to cook for a while, a long while- so I hope you&#39;re not hungry- because your house is about to smell AMAZE-BALLZ."
- "Keep checking the peppers as they cook, sometimes they&#39;ll float and flip over."
- "About three hours or so, they should be ready to be inhaled. (You can check by poking the pepper and seeing how soft they are- the softer, the better.)"

recipeinstructions:

- "Start by adding your crushed saltines and a splash of milk and mix to make a loose paste. Add the rest of your ingredients to the mixing bowl except for the crushed red pepper and mix well. I cook one meatball to test the heat and salt content. I noticed mine were not very spicy so I added 2 tbsp of crushed red pepper."
- "To cook the meatballs I use a bit of a non traditional method. I will add a can of tomato sauce and a can of water with a few pinches of salt to a small pot. In batches I will roll the meatballs and add them for about 5 to 7 minutes or until slightly firm and cooked through and then set aside on a foil lined baking sheet. This way your meatballs will retain their round shape."
- "If your making a traditional pasta sauce you can add them to the sauce and just allow them to cook until service. If not doing a traditional sauce that they can steep in I allow them to cool in the fridge and when ready for service I add some evo to a large pan and sear them to get really nice color."

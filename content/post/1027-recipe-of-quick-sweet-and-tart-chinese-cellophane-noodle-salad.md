recipeinstructions:
- "I use mild vinegar but use less than listed if using normal vinegar."

- "The noodles are lightly coated with sesame oil, so it&#39;s easy to mix them in the sauce. The ▲ sesame oil is for flavoring, so don&#39;t forget to add it ."
- "Add all other ingredients, and toss well."
- "If you want to make the whole salad spicy, add the mustard paste. Use as much as you like."
- "The sweet and sour salad is ready! If you want to make it spicy individually on your plate, add 1 or 2 drops of ra-yu and toss."

- "And stir well to mix the milk properly."
- "Add 200 ml to the pan and heat."
- "Cover and leave 10 minutes over a very low heat."
- "It&#39;s a good time to do your poppadoms if you are going to make some. Also to start heating a pan full of water."
- "Turn the heat off and extract the anise star and cardamoms."
- "Blitz to make a sauce, return to the pan and add a gollup of creme fraiche (optional). Stir well."
- "Put the rice noodles in the pan when the water is boiling. Turn the heat off and leave for four minutes."
- "When the sauce starts bubbling, add the prawns and cook for a few minutes - careful not to leave for too long so they don&#39;t get tough. 3 minutes max. should be enough"
- "Put the poppadoms on a plate with some chutney. Rinse the rice noodles."
- "Put the noodles in a bowl and the prawn curry on top. Serve like this if your child hates fresh coriander. If not, sprinkle with fresh coriander. And in both cases... Enjoy!!!"
